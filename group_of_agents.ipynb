The theory of relativity is divided into two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. It introduces two revolutionary concepts: that time is not absolute but can vary relative to an observer in motion, and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is independent of the motion of the light source or the observer. General relativity, on the other hand, is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational effect between masses results from their warping of spacetime.\n",
